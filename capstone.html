            <h1 class="block1_title">Project Motivation</h1>
            <p class="block1_text">During my senior year in the electrical engineering program at URI, I have been able to be a part of Team VoltServer CLEAR sponsored by the company VoltServer from East Greenwich, Rhode Island. CLEAR stands for Colored LED Event Automated Reader and ties to the project's motivation. VoltServer wants to be able to read the LEDs from their products and determine their pre-programmed illumination patterns. One use case is for end-of-line testing in the manufacturing environment. This test device would be used to make sure that the LEDs work properly and are positioned in the correct place. This mundane task is currently being done in person but our product will automate this process. The members of Team CLEAR are shown on the left where you can see me, James Kaye, on the far right side of my colleagues.</p>

            <h1 class="block3_title">Upgrading Power Systems</h1>
            <p class="block3_text">My first major addition to the project was to upgrade the old power system for the PCB. 
                Our PCB was going to decrease in size from the previous year's design so that was one factor to consider. 
                The previous power system used DC/DC converters which required extra space for capacitors and inductors on 
                the PCB. In order to simplify the design, I chose to use two voltage regulators that only needed a few 
                external capacitors instead of the DC/DC converters.

            <h1 class="block4_title">Designing a Testing Apparatus and Procedure</h1>
            <p class="block4_text">Next, we had to devise a way to test our sensor in different ambient lighting environments 
                and with the different LED colors we would need to decipher. We agreed on creating a simple setup that would 
                be cheap, mobile, and easy to manipulate. I suggested using a cardboard piece with a hole to hold the LEDs in 
                place since it would also allow us to easily change the LEDs and their angle of light onto the sensor. In 
                order to change the distance, we used ½ inch dowels so that we could move within a 0.5-2 inch range away from 
                our sensor quickly between tests. I then designed an excel sheet that would record all of our data from each 
                test and important information about the environment. After performing numerous tests, we compiled our data in 
                graphs so we could visualize how to build our algorithm for light detection based on color.
