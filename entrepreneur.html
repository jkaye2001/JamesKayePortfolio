            <p class="block1_text">Coming up on a year ago this summer, I created my first ecommerce store by opening an account as an eBay Seller. 
                I began by selling old items around the house, but I quickly became amazed by how many people had interest in the items that my family 
                had left to collect dust. Since then I have explored other ecommerce platforms such as Amazon, Etsy, and Facebook Marketplace and have been 
                consistently making sales on Facebook and eBay. The knowledge that I have gained in such a short amount of time has been invaluable in 
                the areas of sales, marketing and customer service. My latest interests have been around the possibility of using artificial intelligence to 
                increase my productivity in writing product descriptions. I'm using a combination of my knowledge from my engineering background, the ecommerce 
                world, and what I'm researching about AI to create a more efficient workflow for myself. Moving away from my recent interests, being an entrepreneur 
                has been one of the best ways for me to understand how valuable it is to understand things from both a small and big picture view.</p>
