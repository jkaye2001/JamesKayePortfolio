                            <p>This semester, I have started taking a digital control systems course where we are learning 
                                about how to design our own control systems through Matlab and Simulink. We are currently 
                                working on building a control system to balance a pendulum on a moving cart. More details 
                                to come soon as we finish this exciting project!

                    <p>One of my favorite classes so far. Foundations of robotics allowed me to finally explore one of my passion fields. 
                        I have been a fan of robotics ever since I took my first robotics course in high school. In this course we learned 
                        about many different types of robots, sensors, and movement methods. For the last month of the semester, we were 
                        given a final project to have an autonomous robot complete a maze that it had no prior knowledge of. This was all 
                        done over simulation using Python, Ubuntu, ROS and the Gazebo simulation environment with one of their robot designs. 
                        Our team came to the idea that a wall following robot using LIDAR would be the best solution for this problem, since 
                        it could solve any maze we came up against. On the day of class, we all put our simulations to the test and had a fun 
                        competition before finals.</p>

                <p>As a professional elective, I took Mobile Computing last fall and learned about how to develop mobile applications for iPhones. 
                    At the end of the class, we worked in groups to come up with our own idea for an app and build it. My app idea was a workout 
                    app that would provide a 3D model of proper form for a list of different exercises. I recruited two of my friends to assist me 
                    with the design and we were able to incorporate a few exercises, a list of health articles and some bonus features like the 
                    addition of dark mode that I coded myself above.</p>
