                        <p>My most recent project, outside of my classes, capstone and work projects, has been creating this 
                            portfolio website! I created a prototype website a few summers ago to learn more about how websites 
                            are generally designed and to learn about HTML. I ended up learning a ton then, especially that CSS 
                            and JavaScript existed too, and it made the perfect start point for me to pick up from! This has 
                            been another great learning experience even though it's been challenging. If you notice any bugs or 
                            imperfections, please let me know through the “Contact Me” form so I can learn the cause of the problem 
                            and how to fix it. Thank you!</p>

                        <p>Before starting this website, I was exploring the world of web scraping and software programs built to interact
                             with internet pages. As a logically minded person, I make most of my decisions based on data or research. Now 
                             the problem is that with everything I do, it's very time consuming to type something in google and cycle through 
                             webpages or watch a series of ten minute videos until I finally find one that is reliable and unbiased. Here is 
                             where web scraping would make a massive difference for me. I cut out all the time searching, leave it for a bot, 
                             and parse through all the organized information at the end. Above you can see some results from scraping Quora 
                             for “the best weight loss tips”.</p>

                <p>Over the summer, I found someone giving away this free robot because it had trouble starting in the pool. The original owner 
                    had just replaced the motor block that you see in the above photo, however the robot still would not run. I began my research 
                    into how the robot is supposed to function by reading the manual and checking power levels across the main power board. The power 
                    output was correct, so I began to suspect that there could be an issue with communication between the motherboard in the power 
                    unit and the daughter board on the robot. I used an oscilloscope to check the output of the transceiver on the motherboard and 
                    it was pulsing with consistency. My next step was to check the outputs through the waterproof cable that attaches the robot to 
                    the power supply and motherboard. Unfortunately, I had to return to school before I could make any more progress, but I am excited 
                    to continue work on this robot in the summer.</p>
