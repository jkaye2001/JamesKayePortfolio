            <h1 class="block1_title">About Me</h1>
            <p class="block1_text">My passion for engineering began during my high school years in Douglas, MA, where I excelled in all my STEM classes. 
                However it wasn't one of my calculus classes that ultimately led me to choose engineering as a field of study. It was in my high school 
                robotics class when I discovered my passion for designing and coding robots. This passion eventually led me to pursue a degree in electrical 
                engineering at the University of Rhode Island in hopes that I would be able to get a career in robotics later on.
                At URI, I had the opportunity to study with some of the best engineering professors, and I quickly realized that engineering can be a 
                challenging, but highly rewarding field. In my engineering classes, I have been able to develop my complex problem-solving skills, as well as 
                both my creative and logical thinking styles. This has allowed me to approach engineering problems with a unique perspective, which has led to 
                some truly innovative solutions in my designs.
                Despite the demands of my engineering coursework, I enjoy participating in extracurricular activities, including intramural soccer and volleyball, 
                working out everyday and starting my own businesses. These activities have allowed me to maintain a healthy balance between work, school and my 
                personal interests.
                Overall, I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had in my educational and professional career thus far. I am excited to continue exploring 
                the field of electrical engineering, and I am eager to see what the future holds in terms of technological innovation and advancement in my personal career.
